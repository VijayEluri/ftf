About
-----
Full-text Fetcher is an automated tool for retrieving the full-text of a
specific article from a variety of different sources. It was created as a
final year project at the University of Glasgow. The purpose of this project
was to investigate and provide a fully automated and hassle free way of
retrieving articles from the Internet, as opposed to using manual web
browsing procedures.

Features
--------
Full-text Fetcher accepts the following inputs:

- link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMID[PMIDs]
- link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOI[DOIs]
- link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arxiv[Arxiv IDs]
- and standard textual queries

And will perform a search over the following services for a particular
kind of result (pdf document, web page, etc):

- link:http://www.google.com/[Google]
- link:http://desktop.google.com/[Google Desktop*]
- link:http://scholar.google.com/[Google Scholar]
- link:http://biology.plosjournals.org/[Plos Journals (biology specific site(!))]
- link:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/[PubMed]
- link:http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/[PubMed Central]
- link:http://www.scirus.com/[Scirus]
- link:http://ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/terrier/[Terrier*]
- link:http://isiknowledge.com/[Web Of Knowledge]
- link:http://www.yahoo.com/[Yahoo]

FTF will then aggregate these results together and display them (along with
any associated metadata (e.g. from PubMed) that can be found about a
particular match).

Please note that '*' indicates that this is a locally run search service
that depends on installed software on the host machine and not an
independent web service or website.
