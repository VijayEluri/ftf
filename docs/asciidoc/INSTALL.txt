Installing Java
---------------
To install or update Java, please visit
http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp[]. Find your operating system in the
list, click the appropriate Download button, and follow the linked installation
instructions.

NOTE: An online installation downloads a small installer program to your
hard drive, then performs the installation by dynamically requesting data
from Sun's Java server. You must be connected to the internet to perform
this type of installation. The offline installation downloads everything you
need to install Java and can be used when your computer is not connected to
the internet.

Microsoft Windows installation
------------------------------
To install the zip formatted distribution just unzip the contents to a
new folder and execute the included 'ftf.exe' executable.

Generic Linux/Mac tarball installation
--------------------------------------
Carry out the following steps in order to launch FTF:

[subs="normal"]
  $ mkdir ftf
  $ cd ftf
  $ tar xzf ftf-(revision).tar.gz
  $ ./ftf.sh

NOTE: This script was tested on Gentoo (a GNU/Linux distribution).

IMPORTANT: If you have the Java JRE installed somewhere unusual (or not in your
PATH), please use the JAVA_PROGRAM_DIR option in the script.

Installing from source
----------------------
Optionally, "bleeding-edge" source code can be installed with the following
steps:

[subs="normal"]
  $ svn co http://svn.brokentrain.net/ftf/trunk ftf
  $ cd ftf
  $ ant run

NOTE: This requires both Subversion and Apache Ant to be installed.
