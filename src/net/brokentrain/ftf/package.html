        The basic API classes which will be used by most developers when
        working with the Full-text Fetcher. <p>The {@link
        net.brokentrain.ftf.Fetcher} class is the main high level class that
        provides simplified access to both starting and harvesting the results
        of a search.  The Fetcher class is responsible for handling input and
        notifying any subscribing class of any status changes, and ultimately
        results.  The Fetcher class represents the controller linking any
        interfaces to the model which are in the form of {@link
        net.brokentrain.ftf.core.Source Sources}.</p>
