The lookup package is responsible for looking up article metadata based on a
given identifier.

<p>An article is represented with the {@link
net.brokentrain.ftf.core.lookup.Article Article} class. However, this cannot be
created directly, and has various different implementations as laid out by the
{@link net.brokentrain.ftf.core.lookup.DOIArticle DOIArticle}, {@link
net.brokentrain.ftf.core.lookup.PMIDArticle PMIDArticle}, {@link
net.brokentrain.ftf.core.lookup.ArXivArticle ArXivArticle}, {@link
net.brokentrain.ftf.core.lookup.URLArticle URLArticle} classes which must be
used instead depending on the Article type.</p>
