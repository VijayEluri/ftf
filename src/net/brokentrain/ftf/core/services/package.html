<p>The {@link net.brokentrain.ftf.core.services.ServiceFactory ServiceFactory}
class handles the registration and management of individual services. Any
provider wishing to register itself must provide the following code:

<pre>
<code>
    public class MyProvider implements SearchService {

    private static class Factory extends ServiceFactory {
        protected SearchService create() {
            return new MyProvider();
        }
    }

    static {
        ServiceFactory.addFactory("MyProvider", new Factory());
    }
</code>
</pre>

and can then be used normally.
