The core package is responsible for providing the model of the system. Various
behaviours of the system are delegated to one or more subpackages depending on
the service required. Additionally, various data structures that were required
for different operations of these services reside here.

<p> At the heart of Fetcher is the ability to start one or more {@link
net.brokentrain.ftf.core.Source Sources}, which are responsible for traversing
a given URL and obtaining results from this page.</p>

<p>
A result can be identified in different ways. Any result must implement the
{@link net.brokentrain.ftf.core.DataStore DataStore} interface in order to see
what it can optionally provide to a user. The three different interfaces are
mapped below:

<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
  <thead CLASS="TableHeadingColor">
  <tr>
    <td>Interface</td><td>Concrete Implementation</td>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tr>
      <td>{@link net.brokentrain.ftf.core.URLStore URLStore}</td>
      <td>{@link net.brokentrain.ftf.core.URLData URLData}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>{@link net.brokentrain.ftf.core.FileStore FileStore}</td>
      <td>{@link net.brokentrain.ftf.core.FileData FileData}</td>
  </tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>Additionally, the {@link net.brokentrain.ftf.core.SourceManager
SourceManager} is responsible for managing these sources.</p>

<p>The {@link net.brokentrain.ftf.core.Config Config} and related {@link
net.brokentrain.ftf.core.ConfigLoader ConfigLoader} objects handle user
configuration.</p>
